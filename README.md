Term project for SE 577 course (SP 2023)

## About Me
My name is Torie and I am a MSSE student in my third quarter at Drexel. After graduating with a BS in Finance, I began working in the financial services industry right as Covid hit, in March 2020. I didn't have a strong passion for finance, and because I was working from home with nothing to do after work, I decided to take a programming class at my local community college. I absolutely loved this programming class and decided to pursue an AS in Computer Information Systems to fill my time after work. I found a passion, and chose to attend graduate school as a means to transition my career to software engineering. 

I'm taking this course because it is a requirement for the MSSE program, but I'm also very interested in learning about Software Architecture. Many of the technologies discussed in the syllabus are key skills mentioned in software engineer job postings, and I'm looking forward to learning more about those technologies and expanding my knowledge in this field.
